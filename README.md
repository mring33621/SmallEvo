========
A small genetic algorithm framework written using Java 8 features  
VERSION 1.2.1 
* Java 8  
* Maven 3  
* No external dependencies at this time, besides JUnit  
* Note that the current Unit Tests are really just eyeball style tests so I can quickly see if things are working.  
* See examples in the [sibling Examples project](https://github.com/mring33621/SmallEvoExamples)
